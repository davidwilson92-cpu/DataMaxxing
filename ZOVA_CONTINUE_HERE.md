# Zova continuation — local strategy candidate, 27 September 2026

This candidate is NOT deployed. Current production base: b746bada82965baa8f3bf55bf04a921683134b35. Branch: codex/strategy-next-move. Workspace: C:/Users/david/.codex/.chatgpt-projects/g-p-6a8a0aa881c88191a2835a8d53316369/zova-strategy.

Read docs/STRATEGY_NEXT_MOVE_20260927.md first for the iteration log, scores, limitations and rollback, and docs/ZOVA_FEATURE_MATRIX.md for current feature status. Earlier live history remains in the original root handoff under Documents/Codex/2026-08-29/referenced-chatgpt-conversation-this-is-an.

Implemented: confirmed brand strategy separate from proposals; up to three compact Next moves; generated idempotent linked drafts; feedback; finite recurring plans; exact repeat batch approvals; fresh drafts separately reviewed; pause/cancel/time edits; privacy lifecycle and usage integration. Existing users/data/auth/media/social connections and explicit publishing approval preserved. Testing billing flags unchanged.

Validation: 203 automated tests passed (17 existing warnings), JavaScript syntax/whitespace checks passed. Local synthetic browser journey and 390x844 responsive check, no horizontal overflow; Escape returns focus to Next move. Mocked AI/providers, no live posts. Final targeted subscription-guard regression: 21 passed (2 existing warnings).

Before release: run staging PostgreSQL concurrency and worker recovery; real-model usefulness evaluations; approved provider scheduling/Story validation. Live trends are unavailable with explicit evergreen fallback. Batch TikTok settings use individual Studio review. Future content changes require an edited new series; one/future time changes are supported. Do not claim whole-product 8/10 or deploy without authorization.

Rollback: cancel pending series deliveries before returning code to b746bad; do not automatically cancel sending/unknown outcomes. Keep additive tables and completed history. Restore-test a database backup before any release.

Local git origin points to the original local checkout, not GitHub. Do not push to it. No PR or deployment created in this task.
